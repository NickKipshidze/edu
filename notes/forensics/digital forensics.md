## Types of crime

Most types of investigation center of some form of computer crime. This sort of crime can take two forms:
- Computer based crime: criminal activity that is conducted purely on computers (e.g: cyber bullying or spam). This also includes traditional crime conducted on computers, for example child pornography.
- Computer facilitated crime: crime conducted in the real word but facilitated by the use of computers. A classic example of this sort of crime is fraud, computers are commonly used to communicate with other fraudsters to record plan activities or to create fraudulent documents.

## Types of investigation

Not all digital forensics investigations focus on criminal behavior. Sometimes the techniques are used in corporate or private settings to recover lost information or to rebuild the activities of employees.

There are 4 main types of investigation performed by digital forensics specialists. The first three are broadly similar in the activities that involve, but differ in terms of the legal restrictions and guidelines imposed as well as the type of digital evidence and form of report.

## Criminal forensics

The largest form of digital forensics and falling under the remit of law enforcement (or private contractors working for them).

Criminal forensics is usually part of a wider investigation conducted by law enforcement and other specialists with reports being intended to facilitate that investigation and ultimately to be entered as expert evidence before the court. Focus is on forensically sound data extraction and producing report - evidence in simple terms that a layman will understand.

## Intelligence gathering

This type of investigation of often associated with crime, but in relation to providing intelligence to help track, stop or identify criminal activity.

Unless the evidence is later to be used in court forensic soundness is less of a concern in this form of investigation, instead speed can be a common requirement.

## Electronic discovery

Similar to "criminal forensics" but in relation to civil law. Although functionally identical to its criminal counterpart, [eDiscovery](forensics%20process) has specific legal limitations and restrictions, usually in relation to the scope of any investigation.

Privacy laws, for example the right of employees not to have personal conversation intercepted and human rights legislation often affect electronic discovery. 

## Intrusion investigation

The final form of investigation is different from the previous three. Intrusion investigation is instigated as a response to a network intrusion, for example a hacker tying to steal a corporate secrets.

The investigation focuses on identifying the entry point for such attacks. The scope of access and mitigating the hacker's activities.
Intrusion investigation often occurs live/in real time and leans heavily on the discipline of network forensics.

## Evidence and analysis

The main aim of any investigation is to recover some form of digital evidence. Objective data that is relevant to the examination. On top of that the investigator might be asked to make some form of analysis of that evidence, either to form an expert conclusion or to explain the meaning of the evidence.

Here are some examples of the kind of analysis an examiner might be asked to undertake.

> **Attribution:** metadata and other logs can be used to attribute actions to an individual.
> 
> For example: computer documents on a computer drive might identify its owner.

> **Alibis and statements:** information provided by those involved can be cross-checked with digital evidence.
> 
> For example: during the investigation into the sower murders the offender's alibi was disproven when mobile phone records of the person he claimed to be was showed she was out of town at the time.

> **Intents:** As well as finding objective evidence of a crime being committed, investigations can also be used to prove the intent (known by the legal term mens rea).
> 
> For example: The internet history of convicted killer Neil Entwistle included references to a site discussing how to kill people.

## Evidence and analysis

**Evaluation of source:** File artifacts and metadata can be used to identify the origin of a particular piece of data.

**Document authentication:** Related to "evaluation of source", metadata associated with digital documents can be easily modified (for example, by changing the computer clock you can affect the created date of a file).
