We will discuss two common techniques employed by cyber criminals to gain unauthorized access to a victim's system or account: **brute force** and **password spray** attacks. By understanding these attack types, you will be better equipped to protect your systems and recognize potential threats.

## Brute force attacks

**Brute force attacks** are a trial-and-error method used by attackers to discover the correct credential combinations (username and password) to gain unauthorized access to an account or system. This is done by systematically trying as many possibilities as possible until the correct combination is found.

In a brute force attack, the attacker usually utilizes automated tools to generate and test numerous password combinations. This strategy can be time-consuming, resource-intensive and potentially detectable due to the massive number of login attempts made in a short period.

## Protecting against brute force attacks

To mitigate the risks of a brute force attack, implement the following best practices:

- **Strong password policies:** Encourage users to create complex and unique passwords, combining upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters.

- **Account lockout policies:** Lock user accounts temporarily after a set number of unsuccessful login attempts.

- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA to make it more difficult for attackers to gain access, even if they obtain the correct credentials.

## Password spray attacks

**Password spray attacks** take a more sophisticated approach to compromise accounts. Instead of attempting various passwords against one account, as in brute force attacks, attackers try a single (often commonly used) password against multiple accounts. This method minimizes the risk of detection by spreading the attempts over many accounts and making them appear as ordinary user login attempts.

In a password spray attack, the attacker typically uses a list of known usernames and tries a small set of commonly used passwords against each username. As many individuals still use weak and common passwords, this attack type can be surprisingly effective.

## Protecting against password spray attacks

To defend against password spray attacks, follow these best practices:

- **Educate users on password choice:** Teach users about the importance of choosing strong, unique passwords that are not easily guessed or found in password dictionaries.

- **Monitor for unusual login patterns:** Use monitoring tools to detect unusual login patterns, such as numerous successful logins with specific (common) passwords.

- **Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Require users to provide an additional layer of authentication when logging in.

In conclusion, understanding the differences between brute force and password spray attacks, as well as adopting strong security measures, can help protect your systems and accounts from unauthorized access. Encourage the use of strong, unique passwords and implement multi-factor authentication to improve overall cyber security.
