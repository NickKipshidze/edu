A **computer terminal** is an electronic or electromechanical hardware that can be used for entering data into, transcribed data from, a computer or a computing system. The teletype was an example of an early day hard-copy terminal and predated the use of a computer screen by decades. Starting in the mid-1970s with machines such as Sphere 1, Sol-20 and Apple I, terminal circuitry began to be integrated into personal and workstation computer systems, with the computer handling character generation and sometimes outputting to a basic CRT (cathode ray tube) display such as a consumer TV.

## Terminal functionality

The function of a terminal is typically confined to transcription and input of data. A device with significant local, programmable data-processing capability may be called a "smart terminal" or fat client. A terminal depends on the host computer for its processing power is called a "dumb terminal" or a thin client. In the era of serial (RS-232) terminals there was a conflicting usage of the term "smart terminal" as a dumb terminal with no user-accessible local computing power but a particularly rich set of control codes for manipulating the display. This conflict was not resolved before hardware serial terminals became obsolete.

## Terminal emulator

A personal computer can run terminal emulator software that replicates functions of a real-world terminal, sometimes allowing concurrent use of local programs and access to a distant terminal host system, either over a direct serial connection or over a network using e.g. SSH.
